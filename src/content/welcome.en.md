<SiteHeader>Welcome! 🖖🏻</SiteHeader>

My name is Archil Lelashvili, I am a software engineer building dynamic, semantic, accessible, and user-friendly web applications.

Welcome to my personal page. I'm excited to share my work, projects, and insights into my journey in web development. Glad to have you here!

This page is built 👨🏻‍💻 using React, TypeScript, and styled-components. I haven't used any templates, just skeleton.css for initial basic styling. I added responsiveness and light/dark mode 🌓 support. The latter follows your OS settings and there is a switcher on the top. If you are curious how this page is built, checkout the [source code.](https://github.com/archil-l/archil.io/tree/main)

Stay tuned, there will be more updates soon!
