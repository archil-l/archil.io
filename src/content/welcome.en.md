This page is built 👨🏻‍💻 using React, TypeScript and styled-components. The page contents are stored in markdown files and rendered using markdown-to-jsx. Skeleton.css is used for initial, basic styling. I added responsiveness and light/dark mode 🌓 support. The latter follows your OS settings and there is a switcher on the top. If you are curious about how this page is built, check out the [source code.](https://github.com/archil-l/archil.io/tree/main)
