### My Northeastern University Journey

I began my journey at Northeastern University as a graduate student in the College of Engineering's Information Systems program. During my studies, I served as a Teaching Assistant and later as a Lead Teaching Assistant for two core courses: **INFO 5001 Application Modeling and Design** and **INFO 5100 Application Engineering**. In these roles, I supported students by leading lab sessions, assisting with assignments, and helping them understand key concepts in software engineering and application development.

After graduating in 2022 with a Masterâ€™s in Information Systems, I continued my involvement with Northeastern as adjunct faculty, assisting with the **INFO 5001 Application Modeling and Design** course until May 2025. My time teaching at Northeastern has been deeply rewarding, allowing me to mentor students, contribute to the academic community, and stay engaged with the latest developments in software engineering education.
