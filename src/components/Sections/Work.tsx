        New enhanced summary reports offered streamlined navigation, making it easier than ever to
        find and analyze data. Report Builder Panel enabled consistent interaction across various
        report types with our unified panel experience. I am specially proud of having completed
        this feature with my own team.

        New forms were released in 2023 and offered form builders a drag-and-drop WYSIWYG experience
        when designing forms. I personally built and refined more than dozen field components and
        embeded existing reports into the new form experience. These are my contributions
      </article>
      <ContributionList>
        <li>
          Built and improved 10+ field components for the new forms. Dealt with numbers, decimals,
          strings, dates as well as more complex types like users and file attachments;
        </li>
        <li>Developed reusable components across several internal libraries;</li>
        <li>Improved backend APIs (using C++ & Java) to support new field components.</li>
        <li>Performed accessibility testing and improved screen-reader performance;</li>

        Released in 2022, calendar report for the new dashboards offered new look and feel, making
        them more vibrant and easier to resize. Supported views to see a single day, week, or month,
        as well as drag and drop of events on the calendar to update start or end dates. I
        contributed to this feature by building the calendar report component and improving backend
        APIs. Here are my contributions:

        <li>
          Implemented unit and integration tests using Jest and TestNG (with Java) for all new
