I'm a Frontend Engineer II on the Sortation Planning team at Amazon Robotics. In my current role, I build scalable, reliable, and high-performance web applications to manage and monitor robotic equipment used for outbound dock automation [(see Amazon Robotics).](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/amazon-robotics-robots-fulfillment-center)

I previously worked at the enterprise SaaS platform Quickbase, where I joined as a Software Engineering Co-op and advanced to the role of Software Engineer II. I spent most of my time on a UI infrastructure team, building new features, reusable components, and contributing to Quickbase‚Äôs design system library. I also did significant work on web accessibility testing and improvements, both within my own projects and in collaboration with other teams. I worked primarily in React, using TypeScript and JavaScript, and I‚Äôm comfortable with tools in this domain, including those used for performance profiling and accessibility testing. Below are some of the key features I contributed to:

### Quickbase's Navigation ([Release Notes](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/30212936236948-Quickbase-September-2024-Release-Notes#h_01J7BD3PQ33X5HVGPX3SEJSCM8))

Rolled out in 2024, Quickbase's navigation has been rebuilt from the ground up to provide a more modern and intuitive experience for users. My contribution to this feature was as follows:

- Implemented accessibility features (semantic HTML, roles, keyboard navigation and screen-reader performance), ensured WCAG 2.1 compliance for a new navigation UI and its components, enhancing user experience and performance;
- Built components and implemented interactions for the new Reports Panel;

New enhanced summary reports offered streamlined navigation, making it easier than ever to find and analyze data. Report Builder Panel enabled consistent interaction across various report types with our unified panel experience. I am specially proud of having completed this feature with my own team.

- Led a team of four software engineering co-ops (Master's students from Northeastern University) for six months (Jan-Jun '24) to complete summary report;
- As part of this journey, mentored and assisted co-ops throughout their learning experience;
- Worked on spikes and built prototypes for new features, breaking down larger problems into smaller, manageable pieces.
- Performed accessibility testing and implemented semantic HTML, roles, keyboard navigation and improved screen-reader performance;

### Quickbase's Forms Experience ([Release Notes](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/16259648646292-Quickbase-June-2023-release-notes#h_01GAH1YHWP30JQ63J1ZCZ74YCN))

New forms were released in 2023 and offered form builders a drag-and-drop WYSIWYG experience when designing forms. I personally built and refined more than dozen field components and embeded existing reports into the new form experience. These are my contributions:

- Built and improved 10+ field components for the new forms. Dealt with numbers, decimals, strings, dates as well as more complex types like users and file attachments;
- Developed reusable components across several internal libraries;
- Improved backend APIs (using C++ & Java) to support new field components.
- Performed accessibility testing and improved screen-reader performance;

### Quickbase's Calendar Dashboard Widget ([Release Notes](https://helpv2.quickbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4418012983828-Quickbase-January-2022-Release-Notes))

Released in 2022, calendar report for the new dashboards offered new look and feel, making them more vibrant and easier to resize. Supported views to see a single day, week, or month, as well as drag and drop of events on the calendar to update start or end dates. I contributed to this feature by building the calendar report component and improving backend APIs. Here are my contributions:

- Built the component and improved behavior under different use-case (timezones, updates);
- Improved backend APIs (using C++ and Java) to support the new component.
- Implemented unit and integration tests using Jest and TestNG (with Java) for all new capabilities;
